Meeting Notes 12-18-2014
Bob Tatar & Andy St John at XOS

Implement backup and restore using a shell script and a set of restricted commands.
See busybox. Nothing that doesn't live on the HMM. Test on the HMM early and often.

Base work on existing scripts like skipTube, etc.
Script usage should always include explicit names, paths, etc.

tar process should start by creating a signature file, with a unique 'signature', that will be used to verify that the archive may be 
confidently unpacked and deployed.

created tar file will be named something like xosbackup.tgz and gets written to /data
insure there is adequate space on /data first


untar process looks for the signature file, if none found the process will exit

unpacking will proceed to the tmp directory, copied to /xos
